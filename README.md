# Problem Solving
ðŸ‘‹ Want to become a great programmer ? try to breaking down to small problem

- S1 : Understand the problem
    - can I restate the problem in my own words ?
    - What are the inputs that go into the problem?
    - What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
    - Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enougn information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. Thatâ€™s okay. itâ€™s still worth considering the question at this early stage.
    - How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

ex : Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum.

- S2 : explore concrete example
    - Coming up with example can help you understand the problem better
    - examples also provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works how it should

    - Start with Simple Example
    - Progress to more Complex example
    - Explore Examples with empty Inputs
    - Explore Example with Invalid Inputs


- S3 : Break it down
    - Explicit write out the steps you need to take
        - This forces you to think about the code youâ€™ll write before you write it, and helps you catch any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstandings before you dive in and have to worry about details (e.g language syntax) as well.

- S4 : Solve / Simplify
    - Solve the problem (if you canâ€™t solve a simpler problem!)
        - fin the core difficulty in what youâ€™re trying todo
        - Temporarily ignore that difficulty
        - Write a simplified solution
        - Then in corporate that difficulty back in
- S5 : Look back and Refactor
    - Refactor Question ?
        - Can you check the result ?
        - Can you derive the result differently?
        - Can you understand it at a glance?
        - Can you use the result or method for some other problem ?
        - Can you improve the performance of your solution?
        - Can you think of other ways to refactor?
        - How have other people solved this problem ?
